 * I wanted to create a tool that demystifies how the internet works behind the scenes — not just through dry numbers,
 * but with clear labels, context, and visual cues. This tool makes it easier for newcomers to see that traceroutes
 * aren’t just technical output — they’re a story about how information travels.
